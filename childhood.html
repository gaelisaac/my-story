      <p>
       I have always been close to my parents and siblings  </p>
     
  
      <p>
        Being the first born i have to be a role model to my other siblings and be able to guide them 
      </p>
  
      <p>
      I thank my parents for always being there when i need them and they have helped me in many ways and advised me when am doing a wrong thing
